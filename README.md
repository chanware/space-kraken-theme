**Unleash the cosmic tentacles of perfectly balanced syntax highlighting.**

A dark theme that wraps your code in the depths of space with a comfortable palette of colors. Designed for developers who appreciate both aesthetic beauty and functional clarity.

*(Space Kraken was created by an OLED screen user who doesn't always want to use 100% black backgrounds.)*

## 🚀 Features

- Curated colors that glow without intense contrast
- Intuitive file explorer and tab theming
- Selection highlights that flow naturally through your code
- It just looks good!


### 🌌 Cosmic Coding Experience
Immerse yourself in a carefully crafted space environment where every color serves a purpose. Every token type has its color in the *cosmic* hierarchy - from function calls to comments, all without overdoing the color palette or washing out in common colors.

### 👁️ OLED Friendly  
Deep space backgrounds **minimize OLED color contrast intensity** as the semi-vibrant accents shine without being too overwhelming.

### Language Support

Syntax highlighting for all major languages including:

- **C#** · **JavaScript** · **TypeScript** · **Python** · **Java** · **Go** · **Rust** · **HTML** · **CSS** · **JSON** · **Markdown** · **YAML** · **XML** *and more...*
